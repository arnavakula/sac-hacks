**Student Details**
- Name: Liza Tinku Jose
- Student ID Number: 920817166

**ECS 20 Midterm 1**

**General Test Instructions**
- The test consists of 6 problems.
- The variable 'y' will be calculated by taking the last digit of the student id 12 6 and adding 4 to it.
- If any confusion arises, students should state their assumption and answer the question. All grading will consider the student's assumption. No questions related to interpretation will be answered during the test.

**Problem 1** (20 points)
- Calculate the value of 'y': The value of 'y' is 10.
- Expand the following notations:
  - a) ((2y)(i) − 1) = ΣΞ - 20×100 = 2000, assuming 9 = 100 (2010) (100), 2XIDX (3)-1), 2x10x (2)-1), -2x10x (1)-1)] = 59,39,19..... 1999
  - b) (n+1)x(n+Ⓡ) x..... (ht₁) = (n+y)!/(n+y-2)! = (n+10)/(n+10-2)b (n+8)b = (n+10)/(nt) (n+)(MHD) = (n+10)(n+a)/(nt) to (nt) cancels

**Problem 2** (30 points)
- Determine if the following statements are propositions. If yes, determine the truth value, if no, explain why:
  - a) (2 + 7 = 9) → (1 + 1 = 3) - Proposition, False
  - b) There exists a number y that is less than x, where (r, y) = R. - Proposition, True
  - c) X+3=1 - Not a proposition, it can be true or false depending on the value substituted for x.
  - d) √2 is a rational number - Proposition, True
  - e) X+3=2 is solvable if x is in the domain of real numbers - Proposition, true
  - f) 2+3=2 if and only if 1+1=3 - Proposition, false

**Problem 3** (15 points)
- Show that (a + b) ∧ (b∨ c) → (¬a ∨ c) is a tautology using a truth table. It is satisfiable as the last column in the truth table is all true.

**Problem 4** (15 points)
- Restate propositions in English:
  - a) (p)(a): If I don't love cats and dogs, then I don't love all animals.
  - b) (-) #9: If and only if I love cats and dogs, I love all animals.
  - c) p ∧ (q)! : I love cats and dogs and I don't love all animals.

**Problem 5** (10 points)
- This exercise relates to the inhabitants of the island of knights and knaves created by Smullyan, where knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. If A says "We are both the same" and B says "A is a knight," then A and B are both knights according to the truth value table.

**Problem 6** (40 points)
- Prove the following statements:
  - a) Prove ∀n ∈ N, 4+2 = 13. This was shown to be incorrect.
  - b) Prove ¬(∀n ∈ N, 4+2 = 8). This was also shown to be incorrect.
  - c) Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is even if and only if 5n + 8 is even. This was proven by contrapositive and by showing that if 5n is odd, then n is odd.
  - d) Show that if n²+1 is even, then n is odd, using a proof by contradiction. Proof was provided by contradiction, showing that if n²+1 is even, then n cannot be even.
  
**Logical Equivalences**
- Identity laws, Domination laws, Idempotent laws, Double negation law, Commutative laws, Associative laws, Distributive laws, De Morgan's laws, Absorption laws, Negation laws are all presented in the form of tables (TABLES 6, 7, 8 and 2).

**De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers**
- When Negation is True: For every x, P(x) is false. The equivalent statement is -xP(x) and it is false when there is an x for which P(x) is true.
- When Negation is False: There is an x for which P(x) is false. The equivalent statement is ∃x-P(x) and it is true when P(x) is true for every x.
