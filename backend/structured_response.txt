### Question 1: Optimization of Objective Function (N/A points)

The problem involves the maximization of the objective function 4x₁ + 6x₂ - 5x₃, subject to the constraints:
- 5x₁ - 3x₂ - 2x₃ = 10,
- 4x₁ + 6x₂ - 6x₃ = 20,
- 2x₁ + x₂ + 2x₃ = 7,
- x₁, x₂, x₃ ≥ 0.

Solution: 

1. Start with adding slack variables to transform inequalities into equations. 
2. The initial basic feasible solution (BFS) is obtained by setting x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = 0, which yields: x₁ = x₂ = x₃ = 0, w₁ = 10, w₂ = 20, w₃ = 7, and Z = 0. 
3. After the first iteration, with x₂ as the entering variable and w₂ as the leaving variable, the BFS becomes: w₁ = 20, x₂ = 10/3, w₃ = 11/3, x₁ = w₂ = x₃ = 0, and Z = 20. 
4. In the second iteration, x₃ is the entering variable and w₃ the leaving variable. The BFS then is: w₁ = 235/9, x₂ = 41/9, x₃ = 1/9, Z = 19/9, and x₁ = w₂ = w₃ = 0. 
5. As all variables are nonnegative and all variable coefficients in the objective function are negative, the current dictionary/BFS/objective value is optimal.

### Question 2: Linear Programming Problem using SID 920877083 (N/A points)

The problem involves maximizing the function -6x₁ + 5x₂ - 3x₃ - 10x₄ + 4x₅ subject to the constraints: 
- -13x₁ + 12x₂ + 2x₃ + 8x₄ + 14x₅ ≤ 0, 
- -4x₁ - 4x₂ - 18x₃ + 12x₄ + 16x₅ ≤ 18, and 
- x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅ ≥ 0.

Solution: 

This problem involves adding slack variables and using a matrix to represent the coefficients. By using matrices and determinants, the solution is calculated. 

### Question 3: Maximizing Profit of Sandwich Production (N/A points)

The problem involves determining the optimal number of each type of sandwich (L and S) to produce and how many employees to schedule in order to maximize profit after operating costs. The constraints involve the availability of ingredients and employees, labor hours, and the ratio between the two types of sandwiches.

Solution: 

1. The optimal integer solution is to produce 670 L sandwiches, 228 S sandwiches, schedule 62 employees, yielding a maximum profit of $110.46.
2. The optimal real number solution is to produce approximately 693.761 L sandwiches, approximately 212.1593 S sandwiches, and schedule approximately 61.2080 employees, yielding a maximum profit of $11123.6632.
3. When the number of carrots or employees increases by 1, the optimal solution does not change. However, when the number of bread slices increases by 1, the optimal solution becomes approximately 694.1038 L sandwiches, approximately 212.2642 S sandwiches, and approximately 61.2382 employees, yielding a maximum profit of $11129.1591.
