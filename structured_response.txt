## ECS 020 Midterm1 Solution 

### Question 1: Notation Expansion (20 points)
Expand the following notation:
- a) ΣΞ (2y)(i) - 1)
- b) (n+y)!/(n+y-2)!

Solution with the assumption y=4:
- a) ((2y)(1) − 1) + ((2y) (2) − 1) + ((2y) (3) − 1) = ((2 * 4)(1) − 1) + ((2 * 4) (2) − 1) + ((2 * 4)(3) − 1) = ((124) — 3)
- b) (n+4)!/(n+2)! = (n+4)(n+3)(n+2)!/(n+2)! = (n+4)(n+3)

### Question 2: Propositions and Truth Value Determination (30 points)
Determine if the following statements are propositions. If yes, determine the truth value. If no, explain why:
- a) (2+7=9) → (1 + 1 = 3)
- b) There exist a number y that is less than x, where (x, y) = R
- c) x + 3 = 1 is a proposition
- d) √2 is a rational number
- e) x + 3 = 2 is solvable if x is in the domain of real numbers
- f) 2+3 = 2 is and only if 1+1 = 3

Solution:
| Question | Proposition | Truth Value | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | Yes | F | (2+7=9) is true and (1+1 =3) is false, from the truth table for the conditional statement, we know that the truth value would be false |
| b | Yes | T | There exists a number y in R which is less than x in R therefore, this is declarative statement that is true |
| c | Yes | F | "x+3=1 is a proposition" is a declarative statement that can be either true or false but not both, which in this case is true |
| d | Yes | F | "√2 is a proposition" as it is a declarative statement which can be either true or false but not both. In this case, it is false as √2 is a irrational number |
| e | Yes | T | Given "x+3=2 is solvable" is q and "x is in the domain of real number" is p. This is a conditional statement p → q, and the truth value of q is true, therefore no matter what the truth value of p is, from the truth table of the conditional statement, we know that the truth value would be true |
| f | Yes | T | 2+3 = 2 is false and 1+1 = 3 is false, from the truth table for the biconditional statement, we know that the truth value would be true |

### Question 3: Tautology and Truth Table (15 points)
Let a, b, and c be three propositions. Show that this is a tautology, using a truth table. Decide if it is satisfiable- explain your answer.

Solution:
Let A (ab) A (bv c) = 

The truth table is as follows:
| (ab) A (bv c) | → (¬a V c) |
|---|---|
| T | T |
| T | T |
| F | T |
| F | T |

Since the last column of the above truth table has all True values, the expression is a tautology. Yes, it is satisfiable because we were able to prove that the expression is a tautology.

### Question 4: Propositions Restatement in English (15 points)
Restate the propositions in English:
- p = "I love cats and dogs"
- q = "I love all animals"

Solutions:
1. (¬p) (¬q) - If I don't love cats or I don't love dogs, then I don't love all animals.
2. (p) q - I love all animals if and only if I don't love cats or I don't love dogs.
3. p^(-9) - I love cats and dogs, and I don't love all animals

### Question 5: Knights and Knaves Problem (10 points)
This exercise relates to the inhabitants of the island of knights and knaves created by Smullyan, where knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. You encounter two people, A and B. Determine, if possible, what A and B are if they address you in the way described. If you cannot determine what these two people are, can you draw any conclusions?
- A says "We are both the same"
- B says "A is a knight."

Solution:
Let K represent knight and N represent knave.
Also let,
- P₁: A says "We are both the same"
- P2: B says "A is a knight."

The truth table is as follows:
| A | B | P1 \ P2 |
|---|---|---|
| K | K | True |
| K | N | False |
| N | K | False |
| N | N | False |

From the table, we can say that both A and B are knights.

### Question 6: Mathematical Proofs (40 points)
a) Prove Є N, 4 + n = 13
b) Prove (Vn Є N4 + n = 8)
c) Prove that if n is a positive integer, then n is even if and only if 5n + 8 is even
d) Let n be a natural number and let a1, a2, a3, ..., an be a set of n real numbers. Prove that at least one of these numbers is more than, or equal to the average of these numbers.
e) Let n be an integer. Show that if n² + 1 is even, then n is odd, using: a proof by contradiction.

Solution:
a) If n = 9, then 4+9 = 13. Since 9 is in the set of N, then In Є N, 4 + n = 13.
b) We want to prove that the statement ¬(Vn € N4+n = 8) is true. In other words, we want to show that there exists at least one natural number n for which 4+ n ± 8. Let n = 2, which is in N. Then, we have: 4+ n = 4+2=6. Since 6≠8, we have shown that there exists at least one natural number n for which 4 + n ≠ 8. Therefore, the statement ¬(Vn Є N4+ n = 8) is true.
c) We have to prove two implications.
   - If n is even, then 5n+ 8 is even.
   - If 5n+8 is even, then n is even.
   (Detailed steps are in the original text)
d) We use a proof by contradiction. Suppose none of the real numbers a₁, a2, ..., an is greater than or equal to the average of these numbers, denoted by a. By definition, we have: a = (a1+a2+...+an)/n. Our hypothesis is that: a1 <a, a2 <a, ..., an <a. We sum up all these equations and get the following: a1 + a2+...+an < n*a. Replacing a in equation (3) by its value given in equation (2), we get: a1+a2+...+an < (a1+a2+...+an), which is not possible: a number cannot be strictly smaller than itself: we have reached a contradiction. Therefore, our hypothesis was wrong, and the original statement was correct.
e) Suppose P(n) → Q(n) is false, i.e., that ¬(P(n) → Q(n)) is true, i.e., that P(n) ^ ¬Q(n) is true. This is only the case if P(n) is true and ¬Q(n) is true. If Q(n) is true, then n is even. By definition of even numbers, there exists an integer k such that n = 2k. Then, n² + 1 = (2k)² + 1 = 4k² + 1 can be written in the form of 2k' + 1, where k' is an integer; therefore, by the definition of odd, n² + 1 is odd, i.e., ¬P(n) is true. However, we have supposed that P(n) is true: we have reached a contradiction. Hence, the original statement is true.
